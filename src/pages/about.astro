	<h1>Aboute me</h1>
	<p>
		Since I truly believe content is king, I tend to value what's written over who wrote it. Still, if you'd like to know a bit about me, you're in the right place!
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm a Computer Science Engineer focused on extracting value from data. I'm prone to forgetting things, so I write things down. This web space functions as my public diary, 
		a personal archive of everything I explore in my life.
	</p>
	
	<h1>What I’m Doing Now</h1>

	<ul class="list-disc pl-5 marker:text-gray-600">
		<li class="pb-2">
			Since 2024, I’ve been working with a large European company that supports me financially while I contribute as a <b>Data Scientist</b>.
			My role mainly involves applying data-driven approaches to optimize industrial processes, with a strong focus on the manufacturing sector. 
			This includes analyzing production data, identifying inefficiencies, and helping design solutions that improve performance, reduce waste, and increase overall productivity.
		</li>
		<li>
			In addition to my main job, I enjoy exploring new ideas through <b>personal side projects</b>. 
			These projects allow me to experiment with technologies I’m passionate about and continue learning outside of work.
			Currently, I’m dedicating my free time to building <i>{AboutMe_data.current_side_project}</i>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Publications</h1>
	<p>
		During my academic journey, I also had the chance to work on projects that led to publications in conferences and peer-reviewed journals. I contributed to a few papers, 
		mainly exploring how machine learning can be applied to optimize manufacturing processes.

	<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
	<p>
		This is the drawer where I keep everything that doesn’t fit neatly elsewhere. On <i>“a day that doesn’t rain much,”</i> I’ll fill this part with interesting information.
